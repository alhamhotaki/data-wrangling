# Data-wrangling
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries and gathering data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. The  wrangling efforts are documented in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualisations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.
The dataset used for wrangling (and analysing and visualising) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with humorous comments about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for this report to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.
